    "text": "&gt; Utopia my ass<p>It actually IS a Utopia, by Thomas More&#x27;s original definition; a society that appears idyllic and perfectly organised on the surface, but is only maintained in that state by everyone doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  And that is achieved by enforcing total compliance through surveillance and coercion.<p>The point of the book is that the reader really wouldn&#x27;t want to live in Utopia once he understands the misery it requires.",
