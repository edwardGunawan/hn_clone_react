What if someone is sitting next to me, or someone is grabbing screenshots or streaming my screen? It&#x27;s like having this super secure electrified iron door installed but neglecting to lock it.<p>Is anyone aware of a technical reason that copy to clipboard is absent in Firefox, or is just laziness? If laziness, I&#x27;ll dump them tomorrow.",
