    "text": "&gt;Israel does better than anyone else in the world at minimizing civilian causalities, but accidents are a fact of war.<p>Israel regularly shoots and kills unarmed civilians for standing too close to a fence.<p>&gt;So, what other options does Israel have? Let the combatants do whatever they want?<p>They are unarmed civilians, standing near a fence.<p>&gt;Are you seriously implying someone should not work for the Israeli military because of civilian accidents?<p>Yes, one should not involve themselves in a violent force that regularly murders civilians for standing too close to a fence.<p>&gt;What&#x27;s your endgame here? Israel should give up and let millions of people be murdered?<p>They can start by not murdering the desperate civilians protesting the blockade and destruction of their homes by standing too close to a fence.<p>&gt;he would rather millions of Israeli citizens get murdered?<p>Millions of Israelis are not at risk of being murdered by the unarmed civilians standing near fences.<p>&gt;The only moral thing to do here is do an even better job at this type of software to make the civilian casualty ratio even better.<p>The most moral thing to do would be to pressure Israel to stop murdering civilians for standing too near a fence.",
